		<h3>Mesh Topology</h3>
		<dl>
			<di>
			<u>Overview</u>
			<dd>
				A mesh network is a network topology in which each node relays data for the network. All mesh nodes cooperate in the distribution of data in the network.<br>
			</dd>
			<di>
			<u>Introduction</u>
			<dd>Mesh networks can relay messages using either a flooding technique or a routing technique. With routing, the message is propagated along a path by hopping from node to node until it reaches its destination. To ensure all its paths' availability, the network must allow for continuous connections and must reconfigure itself around broken paths, using self-healing algorithms such as Shortest Path Bridging. Self-healing allows a routing-based network to operate when a node breaks down or when a connection becomes unreliable. As a result, the network is typically quite reliable, as there is often more than one path between a source and a destination in the network. Although mostly used in wireless situations, this concept can also apply to wired networks and to software interaction.<br>
				A mesh network whose nodes are all connected to each other is a fully connected network. Fully connected wired networks have the advantages of security and reliability: problems in a cable affect only the two nodes attached to it. However, in such networks, the number of cables, and therefore the cost, goes up rapidly as the number of nodes increases.<br>
				Mesh networks can be considered a type of an ad-hoc network. Thus, mesh networks are closely related to mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs), although MANETs also must deal with problems introduced by the mobility of the nodes.

		<h3>Star Topology</h3>
		<dl>
			<di>
			<u>Overview</u>
			<dd>
				Star networks are one of the most common computer network topologies. <br>
			</dd>
			<di>
			<u>Introduction</u>
			<dd>
				Star networks are one of the most common computer network topologies. In its simplest form, a star network consists of one central switch, hub or computer, which acts as a conduit to transmit messages. This consists of a central node, to which all other nodes are connected; this central node provides a common connection point for all nodes through a hub. In star topology, every node (computer workstation or any other peripheral) is connected to a central node called a hub or switch. The switch is the server and the peripherals are the clients. A star network is an implementation of a Spoke–hub distribution paradigm in computer networks. Thus, the hub and leaf nodes, and the transmission lines between them, form a graph with the topology of a star. If the central node is passive, the originating node must be able to tolerate the reception of an echo of its own transmission, delayed by the two-way transmission time (i.e. to and from the central node) plus any delay generated in the central node. An active star network has an active central node that usually has the means to prevent echo-related problems.<br>
				The star topology reduces the damage caused by line failure by connecting all of the systems to a central node. When applied to a bus-based network, this central hub rebroadcasts all transmissions received from any peripheral node to all peripheral nodes on the network, sometimes including the originating node. All peripheral nodes may thus communicate with all others by transmitting to, and receiving from, the central node only. The failure of a transmission line linking any peripheral node to the central node will result in the isolation of that peripheral node from all others, but the rest of the systems will be unaffected.<br>
				It is also designed with each node (file servers, workstations, and peripherals) connected directly to a central network hub, switch, or concentrator.</br>
				Data on a star network passes through the hub, switch, or concentrator before continuing to its destination. The hub, switch, or concentrator manages and controls all functions of the network. It also acts as a repeater for the data flow. This configuration is common with twisted pair cable. However, it can also be used with coaxial cable or optical fibre cable

		<h3>Ring Topology</h3>
		<dl>
			<di>
			<u>Overview</u>
			<dd>
				A bus network is a network topology in which nodes are directly connected to a common linear (or branched) half-duplex link called a bus
			</dd>
			<di>
			<u>Introduction</u>
			<dd>
				A host on a bus network is called a Station or workstation. In a bus network, every station receives all network traffic, and the traffic generated by each station has equal transmission priority. A bus network forms a single network segment and collision domain. In order for nodes to transmit on the same bus simultaneously, they use a media access control technology such as carrier sense multiple access (CSMA) or a bus master.<br>If any link or segment of the bus is severed, all network transmission ceases due to signal bounce caused by the lack of a terminating resistor.
